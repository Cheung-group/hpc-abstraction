# hpc-abstraction

This repository contains all the projects that were developed during Millad's PhD with brief description for each.

## pointerchain

Available at: https://github.com/milladgit/pointerchain

With our proposed directive, pointerchain, developers are able to abstract a chain of pointers in their code to minimize their effort in porting their code.


## Porting CoMD to OpenACC with pointerchain

Available at: https://github.com/milladgit/CoMD-OpenACC

This repository contains a ported version of CoMD with OpenACC. CoMD is a classical molecular dynamics proxy application. It is used by computer scientists to study the workloads of the molecular dynamics applications. In this project, we ported CoMD to the directive-based programming model, OpenACC, with the help of pointerchain.



## Gecko

Available at: https://github.com/milladgit/gecko

This repository contains an implementation of the Gecko hierarchical model with directive-based programming models. 


## gecko-rodinia

Available at: https://github.com/milladgit/gecko-rodinia

Original version available at: https://github.com/milladgit/rodinia

This repository contains the source codes for the Rodinia benchmark ported to Gecko.


## Gecko-BabelStream

Available at: https://github.com/milladgit/Gecko-BabelStream

Original version available at: https://github.com/UoB-HPC/BabelStream

This repository contains the source codes for the Gecko version of Stream benchmark.


## gecko-microbench

Available at: https://github.com/milladgit/gecko-microbench

This repository contains the source codes for a set of microbenchmarks written in Gecko (vector addition, stencil, matrix multiplication (GEMM))




## deepcopy-benchmark

Available at: https://github.com/milladgit/deepcopy-benchmark

This repository contains a set of microbenchmarks that we developed to measure the implications of "deep copy" with respect to performance.

We used Google Benchmark (https://github.com/google/benchmark) in our codes.
